The Adam and Eve story in selectable text (plain text, .txt). <br>
</h3>

I have been, by hand, transcripted the entire thing into plain text to easy things when copy-and-pasting or when using it digitally. I am planing to do a translation into Spanish. Please, be welcome and read the contributions and rules before anything.

**Contributions**
- Have in mind I basically copied by hand the entire thing, so there might be some places in which I fucked up. If you happen to spot any, please be welcome and fix it.
- If you are planing to add an entire translation, you will be monitoring all of the pull requests and issues that the translation is going to receive.

**Rules**
1. The `.txt` files will only contain text in words. There will not be any ASCII art allowed.
2. The words in `English.txt` will directly correspond to the words represented from the 7th page until the end of the declassified document. The words and gramatical signs (such as the dot, the comma, the colon, the semicolon, etc) are to be placed exactly where the original book places them. Please try to match every single uppercase and lowercase letter as well.
3. Bare in mind we will omit every footnote and endnote from the CIA. We are only interested in the contents of the book.
4. Please, also omit page numbering and do not try to mimic spaces between pages by entering a bunch of new lines.
5. Neither of us is to add words, in any quantity, that does not belong to the original book. Meaning, we cannot add notes to the book such as "In this page, there is a depiction of..." or "Here I believe the author..." in any regard, in any form.
6. Pls keep paragraphs in the same line, and only jump to another line when the paragraph ends.

I'm open to almost anything really, as long as we always deal with the pure contents of that shit.

NOTE: THIS IS NOT A PLACE TO WORSHIP, NOR TO CREATE CONTROVERSY. THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THERE WILL NOT BE TOLERATED ANY DEEP KINDS OF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE BOOK OR ITS CONTENTS IN THE ISSUES OR PULL REQUESTS OF THIS REPOSITORY. THIS IS NOT A FORUM. I HATE IT, YOU SHOULD AS WELL.
