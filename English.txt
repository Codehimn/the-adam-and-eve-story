The NEXT CATACLYSM
Like Noah's
6,500 years ago....
Like Adam and Eve's
11,500 years ago....
This, too,
will come to pass....

With a rumble so low as to be inaudible, growing, throbbing, then fuming into a thundering roar, the earthquake starts.... only it's not like any earthquake in recorded history.
In California the mountains shake like ferns in a breeze; the mighty Pacific rears back and piles up into a mountain of water more than two miles high, then starts its race eastward.
With the force of a thousand armies the wind attacks, ripping, shredding everything in its supersonic bombardment. The unbelievable mountain of Pacific seawater follows the wind eastward, burying Los Angeles and San Francisco as if they were but grains of sand.
Nothing - but nothing - stops the relentless, overwhelming onslaught of wind and ocean.
Across the continent the thousand mile-per-hour wind wreaks its unholy vengeance, everywhere, mercilessly, unceasingly. Every living thing is ripped into shreds while being blown across the countryside; and the earthquake leaves no place untouched. In many places the earth's molten sub-layer breaks through and spreads a sea of white-hot liquid fire to add to the holocaust.
Within three hours the fantastic wall of water moves across the continent, burying the wind-ravaged land under two miles of seething water coast-to-coast. In a fraction of a day all vestiges of civilization are gone, and the great cities - Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas, New York - are nothing but legends. Barely a stone is left where millions walked just a few hours before.
A few lucky ones who manage to find shelter from the screaming wind on the lee side of Pike's Peak watch the sea of molten fire break through the quaking valleys below. The raging waters follow, piling higher and higher, steaming over the molten earth-fire, and risingalmost to their feet. Only great mountains such as this one can withstand the cataclysmic onslaught.
North America is not alone in her death throes. Central America suffers the same cannonade - wind, earth-fire, and inundation.
South America finds the Andes not high enough to stop the cataclysmic violence pounded out by nature in her berserk rage. In less than a day, Ecuador, Peru, and western Brazil are shaken madly by the devastating earthquake, burned by molten earth-fire, buried under cubic miles of torrential Pacific seas, and then turned into a frozen hell. Everything freezes. Man, beast, plant, and mud are all rock-hard in less than four hours.
Europe cannot escape the onslaught. The raging Atlantic piles higher and higher upon itself, following the screeching wind eastward. The Alps, Pyrennes, Urals, and Scandinavian mountains are shaken and heaved even higher before the wall of water strikes.
Western Africa and the sands of the Sahara vanish in nature's wrath, under savage attack by wind and ocean. The area bounded by the Congo, South Africa, and Kenya suffers only severe earthquakes and winds - no inundation. Survivors there marvel at the Sun, standing still in the sky for nearly half a day.
Eastern Siberia and the Orient suffer a strange fate indeed - as though a giant subterranean scythe sweeps away the earth's foundations, accompanied by the wind in its screaming symphony of supersonic death and destruction. As the Arctic basin leaves its polar home, eastern Siberia, Manchuria, China, and Burma are subjected to the same annihilation as South America: wind, earth-fire, inundation, and freezing. Jungle animals are shredded to ribbons by the wind, piled into mountains of flesh and bone, and buried under avalanches of seawater and mud. Then comes the terrible, paralyzing cold. Not man, nor beast, nor plant, nor earth is left unfrozen in the entire eastern Asian continent, most of which remains below sea level.
East of the Urals, in western Siberia, a few lucky people survive the fantastic winds and quakes.
Antarctica and Greenland with their ice caps, now rotate around the earth in the Torrid Zone; and the fury of wing and inundation marches on for six days and nights. During the sixth day the oceans start to settle in their new homes, running off the high grounds.
On the seventyh day the horrendous rampage is over. The Arctic ice age is ended - and a new stone age begins. The oceans - the great homogenizers - have laid down another deep layer of mud over the existing strata in the great plains, as exposed in the Grand Canyon, Painted Desert, and Badlands.
The Bay of Bengal basin, just east of India, is now at the North Pole. THe Pacific Ocean, just west of Peru, is at the South Pole. Greenland and Antarctica, now rotating equatorially in the Torrid Zone, find their ice caps dissolving madly in the tropical heat. Massive walls of water and ice surge toward the oceans, taking everything - from mountains to plains - in gushing, heaving paths, creating immense seasonal moraines. In less than twenty-five years the ice caps are gone, and the oceans around the world rise over two hundred feet with the new-found water. The Torrid Zone will be shrouded in a fog for generations from the enourmous amounts of moisture poured into the atmosphere by the melting ice caps.
New ice caps begin to form in the new polar areas. Greenland and Antarctica emerge with verdant, tropical ical foliage. Australia emerge with verdant, tropical foliage. Australia is the new, unexplored continent in the North Temperate Zone, with only a few handfuls of survivors populating its vastness. New York lies at the bottom of the Atlantic, shattered, melted by earth-fire, and covered by unbelievable amounts of mud. Of San Francisco and Los Angeles, not a trace is left.
Egypt emerges from its Mediterranean inundation new and higher - still the land of the ages. The commonplace of our time becomes the mysterious Baalbek of the new era.
A new era! Yes, the cataclysm has done its work well. The greatest population regulator of all does once more for man what he refuses to do for himself, and drives the pitiful few who survive into a new stone age.
Once more the earth has shifted its 60-mile thick shell, with the poles moving almost to the equator in a fraction of a day. Again, the atmosphere and oceans, refusing to change direction with the earth's shell, have wiped out almost all life.
After this tumble we join Noah, Adam and Eve, Atlantis, Mu, and Olympus - and Jesus joins Osiris, Ta'aroa, Zeus, and Vishnu.

THE GREAT FLOODS

Noah? Adam and Eve? Vishnu? Osiris? What do they have in common? THey represent eras ages apart - and yet, somehow, they all join hands in the next cataclysm, and walk with us.
There are others who walk with us, too: men of science - long forgotten - those who first saw that these tumbles, these cataclysmic catastrophes, or "revolutions" of the earth's shell have happened before, countless times. J. Andre DeLuc in 1779 and Georges Cuvier in 1812 were the foremost. Dolomieu, the famous mineralogist, joined the consensus, as did Escher and Forel, the Swiss geologists; also J. Andre DeLuc Jr., and Von Buch. They all agreed that the cataclysms were caused by sudden revolutions of the surface of the earth.
Cuvier, in his "Theory of the Earth," first published in 1812 based his conclusions on his unparalleled correlative research in stratigraphy, comparative anatomy, and palaeontology. At that time he wrote: "Every part of the earth, every hemisphere, every continent, exhibits the same phenomenon.... There has, therefore, been a succession of variations in the economy of organic nature...the various catastrophes which have disturbed the strata...have given rise to numerous shiftings of this (continental) basin....It is of much importance to mark, that these repeated irruptions and retreats of the sea have neither been slow nor gradual; on the contrary, most of the catastrophes which occasioned them have been sudden; and this is especially easy to be proved, with regard to the last of these catastrophes.... I agree, therefore, with MM. DeLuc and Dolomieu, in thinking, that if anything i geology be established, it is, that the surface of our globe has undergone a great and sudden revolution, the date of which...cannot be...much earlier than five or six thousand years ago...(also), one preceding revolution at least had put (the continents) under water... perhaps two or three irruptions of the sea."
"These alternations now appear to me to form the problem in geology that it is of most importance to solve...in order to solve it satisfactorily, it would be necessary to discover the cause of these events...These ideas have haunted, I may almost say have tormented me, during my researches among fossil bones...researches which embrace but a very small part of those phenomena of the age preceding the last general revolution of the globe, and which are yet intimately connected with all the others..."
Many attempts have been made to answer the charge made to the geological profession by Cuvier to explain these sudden revolutions. Among others, Velikovsky tried it through his study of myths and legends; Hapgood tried it; Brown attempted, and in the process amassed a tremendous library of geological data.
Every time the cataclysmic concept has come to life, the "beast" has been stoned, burned at the stake, beaten to a pulp, and buried with the vengeance; but the corpse simply won't stay dead. Each time, it raises the lid of its coffin and says in sepulchral tones: "You will die before I."
The lastest of the challengers is Prof. Frank C. Hibben, who in his book, "The Lost Americans", said:
"....This was no ordinary extinction of a vague geological period which fizzled to an uncertain end. This death was catastrophic and all inclusive....What caused the death of forty million animals....The "corpus delicti" in this mystery may be found almost anywhere...Their bones lie bleaching in the sands of Florida and in the gravels of New Jersey. THey weather out of the dry terraces of Texas and protrude from the sticky ooze of the tar pits off Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles.... The bodies of the victims are everywhere....We find literally thousands together...yound and old, foal with dam, calf with cow....The muck pits of Alaska are filled with evidence of universal death... a picture of quick extinction...Any argument as to the cause... must apply to North America, Siberia, and Europe as well.
"...Mammoth and bison were torn and twisted as though by a cosmic hand in a godly rage.
"...In many places the Alaskan muck blanket is packed with animal bones and debris in trainload lots... mammoth, mastodon... bison, horses, wolves, bears, and lions...A faunal population...in the middle of some cataclysmic catastrophe...was suddenly frozen...in a grim charade."
Fantastic winds; volcanic burning; inundation and burial in muck; preservation by deep-freeze. "Any good solution to a consuming mystery must answer all of the facts," challenges Hibben.
