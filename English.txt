The NEXT CATACLYSM
Like Noah's
6,500 years ago....
Like Adam and Eve's
11,500 years ago....
This, too,
will come to pass....

With a rumble so low as to be inaudible, growing, throbbing, then fuming into a thundering roar, the earthquake starts.... only it's not like any earthquake in recorded history.
In California the mountains shake like ferns in a breeze; the mighty Pacific rears back and piles up into a mountain of water more than two miles high, then starts its race eastward.
With the force of a thousand armies the wind attacks, ripping, shredding everything in its supersonic bombardment. The unbelievable mountain of Pacific seawater follows the wind eastward, burying Los Angeles and San Francisco as if they were but grains of sand.
Nothing - but nothing - stops the relentless, overwhelming onslaught of wind and ocean.
Across the continent the thousand mile-per-hour wind wreaks its unholy vengeance, everywhere, mercilessly, unceasingly. Every living thing is ripped into shreds while being blown across the countryside; and the earthquake leaves no place untouched. In many places the earth's molten sub-layer breaks through and spreads a sea of white-hot liquid fire to add to the holocaust.
Within three hours the fantastic wall of water moves across the continent, burying the wind-ravaged land under two miles of seething water coast-to-coast. In a fraction of a day all vestiges of civilization are gone, and the great cities - Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas, New York - are nothing but legends. Barely a stone is left where millions walked just a few hours before.
A few lucky ones who manage to find shelter from the screaming wind on the lee side of Pike's Peak watch the sea of molten fire break through the quaking valleys below. The raging waters follow, piling higher and higher, steaming over the molten earth-fire, and risingalmost to their feet. Only great mountains such as this one can withstand the cataclysmic onslaught.
North America is not alone in her death throes. Central America suffers the same cannonade - wind, earth-fire, and inundation.
South America finds the Andes not high enough to stop the cataclysmic violence pounded out by nature in her berserk rage. In less than a day, Ecuador, Peru, and western Brazil are shaken madly by the devastating earthquake, burned by molten earth-fire, buried under cubic miles of torrential Pacific seas, and then turned into a frozen hell. Everything freezes. Man, beast, plant, and mud are all rock-hard in less than four hours.
Europe cannot escape the onslaught. The raging Atlantic piles higher and higher upon itself, following the screeching wind eastward. The Alps, Pyrennes, Urals, and Scandinavian mountains are shaken and heaved even higher before the wall of water strikes.
Western Africa and the sands of the Sahara vanish in nature's wrath, under savage attack by wind and ocean. The area bounded by the Congo, South Africa, and Kenya suffers only severe earthquakes and winds - no inundation. Survivors there marvel at the Sun, standing still in the sky for nearly half a day.
Eastern Siberia and the Orient suffer a strange fate indeed - as though a giant subterranean scythe sweeps away the earth's foundations, accompanied by the wind in its screaming symphony of supersonic death and destruction. As the Arctic basin leaves its polar home, eastern Siberia, Manchuria, China, and Burma are subjected to the same annihilation as South America: wind, earth-fire, inundation, and freezing. Jungle animals are shredded to ribbons by the wind, piled into mountains of flesh and bone, and buried under avalanches of seawater and mud. Then comes the terrible, paralyzing cold. Not man, nor beast, nor plant, nor earth is left unfrozen in the entire eastern Asian continent, most of which remains below sea level.
East of the Urals, in western Siberia, a few lucky people survive the fantastic winds and quakes.
Antarctica and Greenland with their ice caps, now rotate around the earth in the Torrid Zone; and the fury of wing and inundation marches on for six days and nights. During the sixth day the oceans start to settle in their new homes, running off the high grounds.
On the seventyh day the horrendous rampage is over. The Arctic ice age is ended - and a new stone age begins. The oceans - the great homogenizers - have laid down another deep layer of mud over the existing strata in the great plains, as exposed in the Grand Canyon, Painted Desert, and Badlands.
The Bay of Bengal basin, just east of India, is now at the North Pole. THe Pacific Ocean, just west of Peru, is at the South Pole. Greenland and Antarctica, now rotating equatorially in the Torrid Zone, find their ice caps dissolving madly in the tropical heat. Massive walls of water and ice surge toward the oceans, taking everything - from mountains to plains - in gushing, heaving paths, creating immense seasonal moraines. In less than twenty-five years the ice caps are gone, and the oceans around the world rise over two hundred feet with the new-found water. The Torrid Zone will be shrouded in a fog for generations from the enourmous amounts of moisture poured into the atmosphere by the melting ice caps.
New ice caps begin to form in the new polar areas. Greenland and Antarctica emerge with verdant, tropical ical foliage. Australia emerge with verdant, tropical foliage. Australia is the new, unexplored continent in the North Temperate Zone, with only a few handfuls of survivors populating its vastness. New York lies at the bottom of the Atlantic, shattered, melted by earth-fire, and covered by unbelievable amounts of mud. Of San Francisco and Los Angeles, not a trace is left.
Egypt emerges from its Mediterranean inundation new and higher - still the land of the ages. The commonplace of our time becomes the mysterious Baalbek of the new era.
A new era! Yes, the cataclysm has done its work well. The greatest population regulator of all does once more for man what he refuses to do for himself, and drives the pitiful few who survive into a new stone age.
Once more the earth has shifted its 60-mile thick shell, with the poles moving almost to the equator in a fraction of a day. Again, the atmosphere and oceans, refusing to change direction with the earth's shell, have wiped out almost all life.
After this tumble we join Noah, Adam and Eve, Atlantis, Mu, and Olympus - and Jesus joins Osiris, Ta'aroa, Zeus, and Vishnu.

THE GREAT FLOODS

Noah? Adam and Eve? Vishnu? Osiris? What do they have in common? THey represent eras ages apart - and yet, somehow, they all join hands in the next cataclysm, and walk with us.
There are others who walk with us, too: men of science - long forgotten - those who first saw that these tumbles, these cataclysmic catastrophes, or "revolutions" of the earth's shell have happened before, countless times. J. Andre DeLuc in 1779 and Georges Cuvier in 1812 were the foremost. Dolomieu, the famous mineralogist, joined the consensus, as did Escher and Forel, the Swiss geologists; also J. Andre DeLuc Jr., and Von Buch. They all agreed that the cataclysms were caused by sudden revolutions of the surface of the earth.
Cuvier, in his "Theory of the Earth," first published in 1812 based his conclusions on his unparalleled correlative research in stratigraphy, comparative anatomy, and palaeontology. At that time he wrote: "Every part of the earth, every hemisphere, every continent, exhibits the same phenomenon.... There has, therefore, been a succession of variations in the economy of organic nature...the various catastrophes which have disturbed the strata...have given rise to numerous shiftings of this (continental) basin....It is of much importance to mark, that these repeated irruptions and retreats of the sea have neither been slow nor gradual; on the contrary, most of the catastrophes which occasioned them have been sudden; and this is especially easy to be proved, with regard to the last of these catastrophes.... I agree, therefore, with MM. DeLuc and Dolomieu, in thinking, that if anything i geology be established, it is, that the surface of our globe has undergone a great and sudden revolution, the date of which...cannot be...much earlier than five or six thousand years ago...(also), one preceding revolution at least had put (the continents) under water... perhaps two or three irruptions of the sea."
"These alternations now appear to me to form the problem in geology that it is of most importance to solve...in order to solve it satisfactorily, it would be necessary to discover the cause of these events...These ideas have haunted, I may almost say have tormented me, during my researches among fossil bones...researches which embrace but a very small part of those phenomena of the age preceding the last general revolution of the globe, and which are yet intimately connected with all the others..."
Many attempts have been made to answer the charge made to the geological profession by Cuvier to explain these sudden revolutions. Among others, Velikovsky tried it through his study of myths and legends; Hapgood tried it; Brown attempted, and in the process amassed a tremendous library of geological data.
Every time the cataclysmic concept has come to life, the "beast" has been stoned, burned at the stake, beaten to a pulp, and buried with the vengeance; but the corpse simply won't stay dead. Each time, it raises the lid of its coffin and says in sepulchral tones: "You will die before I."
The lastest of the challengers is Prof. Frank C. Hibben, who in his book, "The Lost Americans", said:
"....This was no ordinary extinction of a vague geological period which fizzled to an uncertain end. This death was catastrophic and all inclusive....What caused the death of forty million animals....The "corpus delicti" in this mystery may be found almost anywhere...Their bones lie bleaching in the sands of Florida and in the gravels of New Jersey. THey weather out of the dry terraces of Texas and protrude from the sticky ooze of the tar pits off Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles.... The bodies of the victims are everywhere....We find literally thousands together...yound and old, foal with dam, calf with cow....The muck pits of Alaska are filled with evidence of universal death... a picture of quick extinction...Any argument as to the cause... must apply to North America, Siberia, and Europe as well.
"...Mammoth and bison were torn and twisted as though by a cosmic hand in a godly rage.
"...In many places the Alaskan muck blanket is packed with animal bones and debris in trainload lots... mammoth, mastodon... bison, horses, wolves, bears, and lions...A faunal population...in the middle of some cataclysmic catastrophe...was suddenly frozen...in a grim charade."
Fantastic winds; volcanic burning; inundation and burial in muck; preservation by deep-freeze. "Any good solution to a consuming mystery must answer all of the facts," challenges Hibben.
The challenge wouldn't leave me alone. Like a hunger, it gnawed at my subconscious. I could hear the deep tones of Cuvier's challenge, "find the cause of these events," still reverberating through the sacred halls of science, ghostly, unanswered. I felt HIbben0s challenge later on, prodding: "...answer all of the facts." I decided that this cataclysmic concept, this catastrophic end which seems to visit our planet time after time, needed verification or refutation once and for all.
The first step was to gather all of the known, accepted data from as many "earth" sciences as possible: stratigraphy, archaeology, anthropology, palaeontology, radiology, oceanography, seismology, glaciology, and many other fields. Correlation of the data between the sciences gave the answer: althoughthere is enough data in each science to indicate that these cataclysms happen, there was not enough to prove the concept; but between-science correlation showed indeed that the concept was true. Not only did it verify that the events have happened, but disclosed when the last five cataclysms were, and what positions the shell of the Earth has been in for the last 35,000 years. So, after years of research, beginning in 1949, Cuvier's challenge had an answer: Yes, indeed the cataclysms do happen. And the last one, 6,500 years ago, was Noah's Flood!
All right. So they happen; what is it that happens each time? The challenge was really two-fold: Find the process - what happens in a cataclysm; and the trigger - what causes a cataclysm to start.
What a chase! And what a dramatic story of the earth's history we uncovered: Civilizations of 20,000 years ago more advanced than our wildest imagination; prehistoric legends from Greece, Egypt, India, and SOuth America which became history instead of legend; lost continents in the Atlantic and Pacific which became dated realities, with logical reasons for their sudden disappearance.
Yes, Vishnu came alive: a man who lived through a cataclysm 70,000 years before our time - actually ten cataclysms ago! Now he is known as the Hindu god of ten resurrections from the waters. Osiris, too, was rediscovered; he was the Jesus of his time - a man of Egypt, some 15,000 years ago. NOah smiled at us from the pages of the "Epic of Gilgamesh"; he actually was a Sumerian named Utnapishtim, who lived 6,500 years ago. The ark he built is more than legend.
The process of a cataclysm is known now.
Look at the cross-section of the Earth inside the front cover. You'll see two molten layers - the orange ones. The important one is the thin molten layer about 60 miles thick, which is between 60 and 120 miles down, below the surface of the earth. The thick, deep molten layer, starting 1800 miles down at the bottom of the mantle, and extending 1300 miles deeper, is the outer core.
Now both molten layers are liquid; however, the inner magnetic and electrical structure of the Earth makes these layers act as if they were near solid, or plastic. As long as the magnetic and electrical structure maintains its orderliness, this old earth keeps on rotating on its axis in a normal manner.
The growing ice caps - Antarctica and Greenland - are not centered on the earth's axis; and, because they rotate around the poles, are trying to swing down to the equator. The only way they could do it would be to pull the whole 60-mile thick shell around with them. As long as the shallow molten layer stays plastic, the shell won't shift; but once every few thousand years the magnetic and electrical orderliness inside the Earth is disrupted, and the molten layer is allowed to act like a free liquid, which it was all the time anywar. It then serves as a lubricant for the ice caps to pull the shell of the earth around the inside.
In 1/4 to 1/2 a day the poles move almost to the equator, and all hell lets loose. The atmosphere and oceans don't shift with the shell - they just keep on rotating West to East - and at the equator that speed is 1000 miles per hour. It has to be, normally, to make one rotation per day. So, while the shell shifts with the poles going toward the equator, the winds and oceans go east-ward, blowing across the face of the earth with supersonic speeds, inundating continents with water miles deep.
Now what about the trigger? This turned out to be the most elusive piece of the whole puzzle. We couldn't rely on some supernatural explanation -like sometime happenings in the heavens of a vague character which actually violated the laws of nature; no, it had to be something natural, a part of nature's ordinary structure, which disrupts the Earth's inner electrical and magnetic structure whenever it happens.
We once thought that Sun spots could be the cause, because they do disrupt the earth's inner electrical and magnetic structure; but we were wrong.
We found out that "nature's power plant" is a motor-generator system existing in many different magnitudes. It's a basic structure of the universe. The energy structure of an atom is identical to a rotating planet; to a blue-white star; to a galaxy; to a supergalaxy; to all levels of supergalaxies including a universe and even more. As a neutron which has escaped from its parent atom's neutral zone will separate into particles, a star - trhough a sunspot - gives off neutral matter which explodes as it becomes energized; so a galaxy gives birth to an exploding star when a "dead" star escapes from its neutral zone in the center; and as a "dead" galaxy explodes when it escapes from the central neutral zone of its parent supergalaxy. A planet, therefore, must act the same at its energy level.
So, apparently once every few thousand years neutral matter escapes from the 860-mile-radious inner core into the 1300-mile thick molten outer core, and there is a literal atomic explosion inside the Earth. The explosion in the high energy layer of the outer core disrupts completely the electrical and magnetic structure in both the molten outer core and the outer 60-mile thick molten layer. Finally the ice caps are allowed to pull the shell of the earth around the interior, with the shallow molten layer lubricating the shift all the way.
You can see, then, that ice ages are not a matter of advancing and retreating ice; it's simply that different areas of the Earth are in polar regions at different times, for different durations of time, with the changes between positions taking place in a fraction of a day.

The overwhelming evidence, when put in order, gives a dramatic picture of which areas have been at the North Pole, when they moved to the pole, and how long they were there:

North Polar Eras      Start      End     Duration
(Areas at N. Pole)       (Yrs. Ago)       (Yrs.)
Arctic Ocean          6,500       ?         ?
Sudan Basin          11,500     6,500     5,000
Hudson Bay           18,500    11,500     7,000
Caspian Sea          29,000    18,500    10,500
Wisconsin            35,000    29,000     6,000

Yes, Noah, Adam and Eve, Osiris, Ta'aroa, Zeus, and Vishnu have much deeper meanings now; and, as they join hands and walk with us, we hear Adam and Eve saying:
"Listen - for now we can truly share our story with you!"

THE STORY
Enigma...
Pursuit...
Unraveling...

It's funny how some things can plague you from child-hood through your adult years. Not big things, but little things, which don't exactly persist, but annoyingly stick their head through your life's door and say "Boo!" just to let you know they're still there. If I made a list of all these things in my life it might take up a whole book.
I'd like to talk about just one of these bugaboos. From the first time I heard the story of the creation and Adam and Eve, it "buzzed" me, as my yound son would say. Now, to me the answer was not simply one of two usual alternatives: either unquestioning faith in the story as it stands, or complete repudiation as utter nonsense.
No, the answer seemed to lie elsewhere. If the story were taught as the truth so uniformly, in spite of its apparent divergence from scientific truths, then to me the true course would seem to be a search for the foundation of the story, which would then lead to a true reading of it.
The pursuit happened almost by accident. Years of data correlation in studying the earth tumbling concept has shown at last tumble to have occurred about 6500 years ago; that Noah, or Utnapishtim, or whatever his name was, did exist and did survive that particular cataclysm.
A friend of mine suggested that Genesis I is almost a perfect description of conditions on our planet immediately following a tumble. On rereading it, I had to agree; Geneis II even mentions that a mist, or flood, went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground.
Well, now! This was worth thinking about. If it were so, then it would be the tumble preceding Noah's (another fascinating story!), about 11,500 years ago. This, then could be approximately the time of the Adam and Eve story.
The pursuit started. If the story did originate with that tumble, in what language was it first written? Certainly not Hebrew or Greek, for as far as we know, they didn't exist at that time.
If we look to men such as Don Antonio Batres Juarequi and James Churchward, we may have our answer. Certainly their knowledge of prehistoric languages could be a key, and later we'll discuss the role of Naga and Ancient Mayan in the story of Adam and Eve; first, however, let's examine the history of Genesis I, II, and III.
There are many schools of thought on this subject, but the most predominant one is that Moses was the originator. This seems not too far-fetched, since Moses was reared in the Egyptian tradition, in a royal household, and probably had access to many religious writings and teachings now lost with the passing of the archives of Egypt, in Alexandria, Heliopolis, and Sais. Certainly the Ten Commandments were a condensation of the forty-two questions of Osiris for entering heaven. If Moses did write part of the Old Testament, he then must have had Naga tablet writings, or Egyptian interpretations of them, handed down to the Egyptians for thousands of years; and the Egyptian priesthood had knowledge of a cataclysm 11,500 years ago. Priests of Egypt are supposed to have told Solon during his ten years in Egypt (about 600 B.C.) that 9,000 years before that time there was a cataclysm which buried Atlantis beneath the ocean. Nothe that 9,000 + 600 B.C. + 1950 A.D. equals 11,550 years ago.
Moses' brother, Aaron, became the first chief priest of the Hebrews about 1300 B.C. Somewhere between 15 and 18 generations later, the chief priesthood having been handed down father-son through the generations, Seraiah (or Seraias) was the chief priest (See Ezra, and 1 and 2 Ezdras). In 586 B.C., in the 19th year of the Nebuchadnez-zar's reign, Seraiah was taken and executed and his son Ezra made a captive in Persia (see 2 Kings). At that time, Jerusalem was sacked, and all Hebrew records including their laws and records of the Old Testament were burned with the temple at Jerusalem, by Nebuza-adan, Nebuch-adnezzar's captain of the guard.
In 458 B.C., during the seventh year of Artaxerxes I's reign in Persia, Ezra was commissioned to reestablish the Hebrew religion and law. According to 2 Ezdras, Ezra rewrote the history of the Hebrews from the beginning, and reestablished their laws.
Now, from 586 to 458 B.C. is 128 years. The lastest that Ezra could have been born was after his father Seraiah's murder, as well could be (see Onan's story, Genesis 38:8-10); therefore, the youngest he could have been in 458 B.C. was 127. He was working on a long memory.
Let's examine this anomaly. As mentioned before, the lineage from Aaron to Ezra contains from 17 to 20 generations, including Aaron and Ezra. Assuming (1) 1300 B.C. for the start of Aaron's priesthood (1290 B.C. is adjudged the time of the Exodus); (2) 458 B.C. to be near the end of Ezra's priesthood; then we find the average priesthood term per generation to be between 42.1 and 49.5 years. In view of this, can we believe that Ezra served his priesthood for approximately 130 years?
It would appear much more plausible to assume that it was Ezra's grandfather, Azariah rather than his father Seraiah, who was the one taken and executed by Nebuch-adnezzar's men in 586 B.C.. Then Seraiah and Ezra would have served as chief priests during the 128 years from 586 to 458 B.C., for an average of 64 years apiece. It is even plausible that Ezra's great-grandfather Helchiah could have been the victim in 586 B.C., leaving Azariah, Seraiah, and Ezra to serve the 128 years for an average of 42 years each, which is even closer to the overall average form Aaron to Ezra, over a period of about 845 years.
This means that the Adam and Eve story was last seen in writing by Helchiah or Azariah, therefore handed down verbally possibly by Azariah, and certainly by Seraiah and Ezra, and finally dictated by Ezra to five sribes. It is the five scribes' writings that we have today as Ezra's work. And the English is not even a literal translation...for instance, "without form and void" more literally would read "raging inundations and horrendus winds"...
Now, through Ezra's reconstruction of Genesis, we are told many things:
1. Because of the usage of "tree", "fruit", "serpent", "cherubim", and other words which were glyphs in the picture language of prehistory, it is evident that the Creation and Adam and Eve stories were probably orignially written in the glyphs of Naga, the predominant Eastern Hemisphere language of 11,500 years ago. This language is nearly identical to ancient Mayan, and the progenitor of many languages, including Oriental and Polynesian tongues, Egyptian, Greek, and Yakut.
2. Moses (and possibly Aaron) may have had access to these tablets, or Egyptian versions of them.
3. Neither Moses nor Aaron knew how to read the ancient language, therefore read the glyphs quite literally.
4. Not being able to read the symbolism of Naga glyphs, in addition to reading them literally, Moses and Aaron (and possibly Ezra) read into the Adam and Eve story the social and religious attitudes of their day. In that time woman was regarded as the root of all sin, a lowly creature, her birth recorded only as an exception, and basically being the cause of man's every downfall-a daily potential. This attitute persists in some religions even to our time.
Is it any wonder that Eve was shouldered with the responsibility for the downfall of all mankind, as a result of interpretations read into the Naga by Moses? And into Moses' reading by Ezra? Perhaps also it was read into the story of Egyptian priests long before Moses' time, and passed on to him as History.
5. THe fusing of two stories (P and J versions) into one to make the story of Genesis I, II, and III may confuse "the man" with Adam. It is possible that Adam, being only nine generations ahead of Noah, with the time span of the Sudan Basin Polar Era covering 5,000 years, was not "the man" referred to in the creation, but his name and later experiences were merged with "the man's" story.
Remember, however, we are informed that Ezra dictated the entire history to five scribes from memory, and this work contains Genesis as we know it today. For him to recall from the archives of his mind what he did-as well as he did-certainly bespeaks of inspiration of a high order; but it also appears evident that he had no knowledge of the fact that 5,000 years transpired between Genesis I and Noah's flood. It is clear from 2 Ezdras 3:9 that Genesis I and Noah's flood represented two inundations, however, for while speaking of the two occasions, he says of Noah's flood: "And again in process of time thou broughtest the flood upon those that dwelt in the world, and destroyedst them."
Now, we mentioned before that the lineage of the high priests from Aaron to Ezra differs in number of generations (17 or 20) and names as presented in 1 and 2 Ezdras; and both differ in names from the book of Ezra. We also find differences in the lineages from Noah to Jesus (approximately 51 generations) in the Bible. Is it any wonder, therefore, that some generations could have been omitted in the Adam to Noah line? And the Aaron to Ezra line?
And in the light of the fact that, in addition to overwhelming scientific evidence, there are countless legends in the Asia-Pacific area, handed down from the inundation of 11,500 years ago, of a creating much like that of Genesis I and II, is it not possible that "the man" of the Genesis story became confused with Adam throughout the thousands of years, and through a succeding tumble and inundation in NOah's time 6500 years ago?
The miracle actually is that the whole story of "creation", and Adam and Eve, is as undistorted as it is, being 11,500 years old, it has suffered through many debacles visited upon its guardians in the intervening years.
Because of the lack of resolving information, "the man" and Adam are kept as one in this translation-interpretation.
6. The significant Naga glyphs given to us by Ezra through Moses' direct reading are:
Cherubims      Man     Fruit
Rib            Woman   Serpent
Adam's sleep   Tree    Flaming Sword
Our knowledge of Naga glyphs tells us that the tree (of life) symbolized a mother continent, a parent civilization lasting thousands of years longer than ours of today.
An unadorned serpent represented water, or the ocean; a serpent entwined about the tree signified that the mother continent was surrounded by water. Genesis III, 15 actually describes Eve's heel on the serpent's head, showing her victory over the oceans.
Cherubims-which were not pretty, plump babies, but hybrid man and beast-were the glyphs for legs, or foundations, or underpinnings. Instead of being placed in the garden of Eden, one was taken away; and a Naga or Maya reading of the Egyptian Book of the Dead shows that cherubims of the North, East, South, and West were taken away-meaning that the foundations of the mother continent, in all directions, were removed or destroyed.
The flamming sword was the symbol of fire and earthquake. THe fire signified what all legends of these cataclysms call earth-fire, which is the molten layer below the earth's 60-mile thick shell breaking through to the surface during a tumble, a literal hell. It is most probably the origin of man's concept of hell, as a matter of fact.
Now back to the tree: Fruit growing on that tree symbolized the original mankind which settled the mother continent ages before Adam and Eve. Their eating of the fruit tells us that they were descended from this original mankind of the continent. Eve eating first signifies that she was the generation after Adam, making her his daughter. His daughter!?
The glyph of the creation is even more revealing. There are three figures represented in this picture; the top figure is the face of a sleeping or dead person (there were no separate symbols for death and sleep in Naga-both were represented as the same). The middle figure is shown as a male, and the bottom figure a female who is representend as the mother of all mankind. In addition, there are curved lines from the sleeping or dead person and the male middle figure to the bottom female figure.
This glyph has been interpreted to mean that the middle figure, a male, was put to sleep, shown by the top figure, and a rib (or ribs) removed from him (the ribs being the curved lines) and fashioned into the bottom figure, the female mother of all mankind. This fits beautifully with the story of Eve's creation, Adam therefore being both the male middle figure and the top figure, a sleeping (or dead) person.
There is a slight hitch to this story, however: the top figure, whether sleeping or dead, is depicted as a female! How could it be Adam, asleep, awake, dead, or alive? Moreover, in Naga the curved lines denote parentage rather than ribs; so, more reasonably, it appears that the top figure is a dead female, whose offspring by the male middle figure (Adam) was the bottom female figure (Eve), the mother of the Hebrews.

So, in essence, the story as read from the glyphs would be that Adam and Eve, who lived in the Garden of Eden in the mother continent (tree), were descended from the original mankind (fruit) of that land, which incidentally was surrounded entirely by water (serpent around the tree). Eve was adam's daughter, and he was a widower.
They realized that, in order to survive, they had to leave and never try to return, for the motherland was to be destroyed by a cataclysmic inundation. They left; and afterward, the continent (tree) was subjected to a fiery earthquake (flamming sword), during which it lost its foundations (cherubims), and sank beneath the ocean (serpent) which forever afterward walked over the sunken continent (on its belly).
So let's review the event-two cataclysms ago- and then apply our knowledge toward a representative translation-interpretation of Genesis I, II, and III. It may be the most accurate reading of a story written 11,500 years ago.

THE EVENT
11,500 years ago...

Did you ever sit down for an evening at a card table with a 1000-piece puzzle? By yourself? It takes hours and hours to put it together, doesn't it, with trial, and error, and patience all playing their parts.
Er're still trying out some of the as yet unfitted pieces in our world-wide puzzle, and we've been "at the table" since 1949. However, even though incomplete, it shows us a graphic representation of the earth's picture 11,500 years ago.
Look at the globe of the World. Pick out Longitude 90°W - Latitue 60°N. This point is in the western part of the Hudson Bay.
Now hold the globe so that 90°W - 60°N is at the North Pole, on the axis of rotation. This was the configuration of the world between 18,500 years ago and 11,500 years ago. The NOrth Polar ice cap formed the Laurentian Basin in Canada.
The continents, however, were not quite the same. There was a huge continent in the Atlantic Ocean area, which stretched from Iceland and England across the Atlantic to the Bahamas. The Gud of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea did not exist - they were land at that time.
There was another continent in the Pacific - covering an area now ringed by the Hawaiian Islands, the Galapagos, Easter Island, Tahiti, the Solomons, and the Caroline Islands.
The Province of Ceylon held the major civilization of India. Egypt and the Holy Land were thriving mixtures of vegetation and civilization.
Greece - land of the Hellenes - was the home of a tall, blue-eyed, blonde race with standards of science and law unmatched to this day.
The Amazon Basin was an inland sea - legends call it the Sea of Xarayes - and the mouth of the Amazon River was then a wide, seagoing connection between the Atlantic and Xarayes. The western coast of South America was not mountainous - the prehistoric city of Tiahuanaco, Peru, now at 12,500 feet above the Pacific, was then at sea level. It was a metropolis seaport, with a canal system for seagoing ships, as large as any we have today - traversing from the Pacific to the inland sea.
Astronomers of Tihuanaco used telescopes like ours of today; and they had a huge satellite orbiting the earth - West to East, 449 times per year - which they used as a time standard, its orbit was so accurate.
Ahoydia, now a suburb of Lucknow, was the capital of India. And the great navigators, the great scientists, the great explorers of the eastern hemisphere were the dark-eyed, dark-haired Mayans.
About 11,500 years ago - in 9,550 B.C., as dated by astronomers from Potsdam Observatory from writings in the ruins of Tiahuanaco - the 60-mile thick shell of the earth shifted its position once more in 1/4 to 1/2 a day, 7,000 years after the previous shift. The North Pole moved southward, and the Sudan Basin in Africa shifted to the North Pole. This was the time which the Talmud states was the setting of the Pleiades below the horizon, when the Holy Land was moved into a "region of terrible cold" for many generations - actually for 5,000 years until Noah's flood, 6,500 years ago.
The equatorial pivot points were off the coast of mid-Chile and in mid-China, near the Yangtze, North of Viet Nam.
The great continent in the Pacific disappeared almost completely - what is now Easter Island, then on the edge of the continent, dropped to remain on the Pacific Ocean floor for 5,000 years - to be heaved up again in the cataclysm causing Noah's flood. What remained of the vast Pacific continent rolled to the South Pole, to be discovered by Mayan explorers as the last remains of their motherland - a "frozen reservoir of mud at the bottom of the earth," millions of square miles in area.
Of the great continent in the Atlantic, only a large island was left in the West, while the ocean between there and Gibraltar to the East was left shallow, muddy, and impassable to ships.
A thread of a clue concerning the great knowledge of that time came out when Captain Cook discovered the Polynesian Maori tribe in New Zealand in the 1700's. They told him of ancient legends of Saturn's rings - and they hadn't even head of telescopes. Now you try to see those rings with your naked eyes - and you'll find out that it's impossible.
The evidence in Tiahuanaco shows that their great civilization was wiped out so suddenly that people were caught in the middle of their normal daytime activities by catastrophic inundation. Further, evidence shows that this fabulous city suffered the same fate as Easter Island: although the Rockies and Andes were started in this cataclysm, TIahuanaco was buried under the Pacific, to remain there for 5,000 years, then to be heaved up to its present altitude of 12,500 feet in the last cataclysm 6,500 years ago.
So the cataclysm of 11,500 years ago saw the Hudson Bay and the opposite polar area just southwest of Australia both roll to the equator on opposite sides of the Earth, and the Sudan Basin region roll to the North Pole, to remain there for the next 5000 years. WHile this shift was occurring, taking only 1/4 to 1/2 a day to complete itself, the earth's oceans and atmosphere, through angular momentum, kept rotating in their normal direction during most of the shift, with the oceans violently inundating most of the lands of the Earth, and the atmosphere bringing unimaginable hurricanes of up to supersonic wind velocities. Whole continents were subjected to tremendous upheavals and earthquakes. The molten layer below the earth's 60-mile thick shell broke through the shell in places all over the world, and was thereafter called "earth-fire" by the pitiful few who survived.....
The oceans and winds took six days after the start of the cataclysm to resolve their holocaustic wars on the surface of the earth, and on the seventh day began to settle down to 5,000 years of normal complacency. The two-mile thick ice caps of the Laurentian Basin and the Indian Ocean, having shifted from their polar homes and started a new course of revolving equatorially, proceeded to melt at tremendous speeds in the torrid heat, carving great grooves in the mountains as the rushing, gushing, swirling water and ice overwhelmed everything in their paths. THe great amounts of moisture being poured into the atmosphere were to shroud the Torrid Zone in a dark fog for many years during several generations. The oceans rose some 200 feet all over the world with the sudden melting of the ice caps, as they do after each cataclysm.
The end of the Laurentian Ice Age, and the start of the "Old Stone Age" was complete.
The Mayan tongue lived on in scattered remnants: Polynesian tongues, Greek, Yakut, Egyptian, Eskimo tongues, Nomadic, Oriental, German, American Indian - just about all languages. The resurrection from the waters - Tau - lived on in many stories of a man who survived, later to become Ta'aroa, Tongaroa, Taroa'a, depending on which tribe's legend you find.
Adam and Eve could have sprung from the same story. Who knows?
